# Contributing to Maester content hub

This document describes how to contribute to the Maester content hub. We share content here, so others can easily promote Maester and show others how to use it.

## Prerequisites

Before contributing content, make sure you familiarize yourself with the [Maester documentation](https://maester.dev/docs/) and the [codebase](https://github.com/maester365/maester). We don't want to provide wrong content or examples that are not working.

## Making changes

1. Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
1. Create a new branch for your changes.
1. Add your cool new content
1. Create a pull request to the main repository with a description of your changes and why they are needed.
1. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed and merged.

> [!NOTE]
> This repository does not have issues enabled, all community content is welcome. We will review and suggest possible adjustments in the PR.

## Pull requests

When creating a pull request, please make sure to follow these guidelines:

- Provide a clear and concise description of the changes you made.
- Include any relevant issue numbers in the pull request description.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.

## Merging pull requests

For those with write access to the repository, please follow these guidelines when merging pull requests:

- Review the pull request thoroughly and test the changes if possible.
- Make sure the pull request follows the guidelines mentioned above.
- **DO** use ["Squash and Merge"](https://github.com/blog/2141-squash-your-commits) by default for individual contributions unless requested by the PR author. Do so, even if the PR contains only one commit. It creates a simpler history than "Create a Merge Commit".
